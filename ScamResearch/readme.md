About this file:

On January 25, 2026, an investment scammer sent me this source code instead of the scam. Unfortunately for the scammer, I'm probably the last person he should have sent the source code, so I'm not analyzing it thoroughly.

The structure of this code is a great example of modular programming.

The "Lure" is separate from the "Engine": By putting the message in its own function (generate_investment_message), the scammer can quickly change their identity (e.g., from "Lloyds Bank" to "Federal Reserve") without rewriting the code that handles the cloud uploading.

Automation of Personalization: The use of email.split('@')[0] shows they are likely processing large lists of stolen email addresses and want to make the files look unique to each person automatically.

Technical Analysis
This script is a template generator and distributor. It isn't designed to "hack" a computer; rather, it's designed to automate the creation of "lures."

1. The Narrative (The "Hook")
The content generated by generate_investment_message() is a classic Advance-Fee Fraud (also known as a 419 scam).

The Persona: "Mr. William Chalmers," an executive from a well-known bank (Lloyds).

The Bait: "Legitimate funds" to invest in the victim's country.

The Goal: To move the conversation to a private email (hotmail.com) where they will eventually ask for "processing fees" or "taxes" to release the non-existent investment.

2. Automation Strategy
The script uses a logic gate to name the files it creates:

If the scammer has your first name, the file is named Name_investment_message.txt.

If they only have your email, it strips the domain (e.g., john.doe from john.doe@gmail.com) to name the file.

Why? This personalization makes the file seem more "official" or specifically prepared for the victim when shared via a cloud link.

3. The Use of Cloud Infrastructure
The most interesting part is the use of gemini and cloudshare imports.

Evasion: Instead of sending a suspicious .exe or a direct scam email that might be flagged by spam filters, the scammer uses this code to host the message on a legitimate cloud platform.

Trust: Victims are more likely to click a link to a reputable cloud collaboration tool than a random attachment.

Security Takeaways
Social Engineering: The code proves that the "Mr. William Chalmers" identity is a mass-produced template.

Metadata: The email address is the primary point of contact. This is a "burner" account used to filter out automated replies and find "live" victims.
