This is the ultimate "Performance Review from Hell." If this scammer were an intern at a real software company, he’d be escorted out of the building before lunch.

Here is the **Senior Developer Code Review** for our aspiring "investment mogul."

## **CODE REVIEW: Phishing Campaign v1.0 (Failed)**

**To:** Intern_Scammer_69

**From:** Senior Lead Architect

**Status:** **REJECTED - DO NOT MERGE**

### **Overall Feedback**

I’ve seen some spaghetti code in my time, but this is the first time I’ve seen a developer accidentally send the **entire backend infrastructure** to the end-user instead of the UI. It’s like a chef sending a customer a raw chicken and a recipe book instead of a cooked dinner.

### **Critical Failures**

**1. Dependency Management (The "Gemini" Incident)**

* `import gemini`? Really? You can’t just "wish" a library into existence. I checked the documentation, PyPI, and the dark web—**this library does not exist.** * Did you ask an AI to write your code and then copy the "hallucination" word-for-word? This code won't even compile. You’re trying to run a Ferrari engine on "imaginary gasoline."

**2. Extreme Information Leakage**

* In the cybersecurity business, we usually try to *hide* the fact that we are scammers. By sending the `generate_investment_message()` function, you’ve confirmed that "Mr. William Chalmers" is a constant string value.
* You literally exposed your "Variable" (the victim's email) in the main execution block. You’ve given the user a roadmap of your entire database strategy.

**3. Poor Naming Conventions**

* `document_prefix = first_name if first_name else email.split('@')[0]`
* Wow, very subtle. I’m sure the victim won’t be suspicious at all when they receive a file named `victim_email_prefix_investment_message.txt`. It really screams "Professional Banking Executive."

**4. Error Handling from a Parallel Universe**

* You have `try/except` blocks everywhere to catch "errors," yet you committed the biggest error of all: **sending the source code to the target.** There is no `try/except` block for "Total Incompetence."

### **Final Verdict**

This is a **Level 10 OpSec Failure.** You didn't just fail to scam the target; you provided them with a free Python lesson and a good laugh.

**Recommendation:** Please hand in your hoodie and your mechanical keyboard. We are moving you to the "Phone Scam" department where you can't accidentally copy-paste your own brain to the customer.

**Would you like me to "refactor" his scam message into something even more ridiculous, or should we just keep laughing at his `import gemini` error?**
