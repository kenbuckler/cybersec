All access cards in this folder are real cards which will never be used in any operational deployment, or cards generated from those real cards.
Please feel free to use them to develop templates for your own custom cards.

Some access control systems only use the card UID for access, and therefore trying out Minimum, 1, and Maximum UID values could reveal defaults which were present in the system at time of installation but not properly removed.
