FCC Frequency Explorer can be very useful for identifying unknown frequencies, see https://fccid.io/frequency-explorer.php

Note for RFID Tags:
UHF RFID tag frequncies listed below typically are passive RFID tags and require an active reader broadcasting a signal which is either backscattered or responded to on a different frequncy by the RFID tag. This means you'll only be able to pick up the UHF RFID tags below when they pass close enough to an active reader. The tags are only activated when the broadcast from an active reader is strong enough to energize the RFID tag. This effect was used by the Soviet Union in the last 1940's to build a passive listening device which only transmitted audio when energized by an outside radio signal source.
